# ProjectX

[![ProjectX](https://img.shields.io/badge/readme%20style-standard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://graduation.cloud/)

We were originally called Xcloud.But then Microsoft introduced the cloud game, also called the name. Lol

The X project is a server monitoring tool written in python.
And with a one-click installation and configuration scripts (automatic configuration currently only supports Centos).
Through this project we came to the conclusion that Python is really a very easy to use language.

This repository contains:

1. [The specification] Client
2. Server([work in progress](http://http://graduation.cloud/)).


ProjectX is designed for Operation and maintenance personnel. Although itâ€™s [historically](#background) made for People with many servers, it also applies to install in other platform and some network managers.
